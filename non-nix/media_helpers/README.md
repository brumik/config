IMPORTANT:

1. Read what each script does before you run it!
2. Have `ffmpeg` installed
3. Copy and set up your `.env` in the same folder as `.env.example`
4. Run the scripts from the ROOT path, otherwise they won't be able to read `.env` file.
5. You probably want to not use my `./scr/blacklist` files :) check it first

# TODO:

- [ ] Create a runner script in root.
- [ ] Document scripts bit better
