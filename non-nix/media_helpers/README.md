IMPORTANT:

1. Read what each script does before you run it!
2. Have `ffmpeg`, `flac` and `mp3val` installed (or use the flake.nix in devshell)
3. Copy and set up your `.env` in the same folder as `.env.example`
4. Copy and set up your `./scr/blacklist` if you do not wanna run quality check on some folders
4. Run the scripts from the ROOT path, otherwise they won't be able to read `.env` file.

# TODO:

- [ ] Create a runner script in root.
- [ ] Document scripts bit better
