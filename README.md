# Config file

This config files hosts all the configuration files I can use on an Unix based system.

The goal is to keep unix based systems the same with the use of external non platform specific applications.

## How to use it

- Clone the repository
- Symlink the folders to the `.config` folder (full path)
    - Example: `ln -s ~/Documents/config/alacritty ~/.config` (to link alacritty)


Some programs needs extra setup (like alacritty needs fonts). These extra setup guides should be included in the 
README of that specific folder.
